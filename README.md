# MARCOMM TEST AUTOMATION FRAMEWORK

### Overview
The **`testautomationframework`** project is MarComm's second automation framework. There were a lot of feedback about the original version being too complicated to use and understand.
So, in this version, we've tried to address that and toned down some of the complexities from the original one. 

We've added a lot of improvements like lots of documentation (including this README) and 
less code verbosity (I think) to make this version a bit more intuitive to use.

At the end of the day, what we hope to accomplish is to help you with your testing needs and be more productive. 

By the way, this README file is a living documentation. As contributors (whoever you may be) add new features to the project, we expect that you also update this file to explain and document
that new feature.
